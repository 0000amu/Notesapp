# NotesApp – Java File I/O Project

A simple console-based note-taking application built using Java. This project demonstrates how to use Java’s File I/O classes like `FileWriter`, `BufferedWriter`, `FileReader`, and `BufferedReader` to create a basic note manager that persists data in a text file.

All notes are saved to a file called `notes.txt` for persistence, even after the program is closed.
